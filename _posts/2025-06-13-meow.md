## port 23 - telnet

find nmap scripts that we can use against telnet, but none of them worked for me (sometimes nse scripts are finnicky...)

```
$ ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep telnet
telnet-brute.nse
telnet-encryption.nse
telnet-ntlm-info.nse
```

try just connecting and see that we need a username and password

time to try brute forcing

# exploitation

maybe `root` doesn't need a password...

![telnet_root_login](/assets/img/image-23.png)

looks like that's it. `cat` the flag and submit it. since we are `root`, no privesc necessary
