## port 3306 - mysql

tried to log in as the `root` user and get the following error

```
$ mysql -h 10.129.95.232 -u root        
ERROR 2026 (HY000): TLS/SSL error: SSL is required, but the server does not support it
```

looked at the `man` page and found that ssl is enabled by default

![sequel_man](/assets/img/sequel_man.png)

try to connect again with the `--skip-ssl` flag and get a login

```
$ mysql -h 10.129.95.232 -u root --skip-ssl
