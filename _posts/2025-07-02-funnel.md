so now i have a domain, users, and a default password

# exploitation

since i need more `hydra` in my life and want to practice doing this as a scalable level, i'm going to use that to see if any of the users can login with the default password

```
$ cat funnel_users.txt

$ cat funnel_password.txt

looks like `christine` is the winner

i look at the processes running and any network connections and see `postgresql` running and the port 5432 (postgres's default port) listening on localhost. but since `psql` isn't installed on the target, i'm going to have to tunnel from my own box to use it. i had some trouble with tunnels in the beginning, but once you get it, it's one of those things that sticks. also [this](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/ssh-tunnels/) is such a helpful reference for fellow visual learners. run the local port forwarding session in the background and check that it was successful with a netstat
