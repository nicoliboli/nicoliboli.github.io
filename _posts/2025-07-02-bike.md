## port 80 - http

use Wappalyzer to look at the technologies the website is using. i've never used it before this, but the question specifically says to do so

![bike_wappalyzer](/assets/img/bike_wappalyzer.png)

didn't get anything with burpsuite, so time to start testing inputs. i tried sqli and xss, but why i got to ssti, i get an error

![bike_ssti](/assets/img/bike_ssti.png)

that's a good sign. so not i know that the template library being used is `handlebars`. [here](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection/index.html) there is a handlebars SSTI. i put the string in the `Decoder` to url encode it and sent it via `Repeater`

![bike_hacktricks_handlebars](/assets/img/bike_hacktricks_handlebars.png)

![bike_burp_decoder](/assets/img/bike_burp_decoder.png)

![bike_burp_exec](/assets/img/bike_burp_exec.png)

that would have been too easy, so of course there's an error

![bike_require](/assets/img/bike_require.png)

at this point i started googling and found [this](https://mahmoudsec.blogspot.com/2019/04/handlebars-template-injection-and-rce.html) writeup about a 2019 Shopify RCE. i got execution when i changed `return require('child_process').exec('whoami');` to `return JSON.stringify(process.env);` so at least i knew i was on the right track

![bike_shopify](/assets/img/bike_shopify.png)

now i needed to know more about why require wasn't working, so i looked at the docs [here](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html) and found out it was a scope issue. there are global objects available and `require` *appears* to be one but is a built-in object that is apart of javascript instead... (literally says that in the docs). the `process` object looks promising (and is actually global). try a test with a nodejs payload that uses process to read `/etc/passwd` (got it at hacktricks again and just CTRL+F'd for `process` until i found a payload that looked like it would work). encoded the payload, sent it, and got the `/etc/passwd` contents

![bike_burp_decoder1](/assets/img/bike_burp_decoder1.png)

![bike_burp_passwd](/assets/img/bike_burp_passwd.png)

now try with a reverse shell. had to try a couple and unfortunately there is a timeout (like a couple of seconds) before my shell gets dead

![bike_burp_revshell](/assets/img/bike_burp_revshell.png)

```

```

so instead see if i can crack anything offline in `/etc/shadow`

![bike_shadow](/assets/img/bike_shadow.png)

save off both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` and use `unshadow` to combine them. since root is the only one with a hash, i just deleted everything but that line (if you don't delete the lines, `hashcat` will give you a `Token length exception` when it starts to run). then i looked for the hash type in `hashcat`'s help menu and queued up a job and let that run. during said run i realized that i can also just `cat` the flag... (in hindsight i probably should've poked around first before just assuming that the flag was at `/root/flag.txt`, but i was right the first time so imma take the win)

```
$ unshadow bike_passwd bike_shadow > bike_unshadowd.hash

$ cat bike_unshadowd.hash
